# Privacy Policy for Daily

This Privacy Policy explains how **Daily** (the "App") handles your information. **Daily is a free, open-source hobby project developed for personal enjoyment.** There is no company, formal team, or dedicated server infrastructure behind it.

**We want to be crystal clear: this App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information from your device to any external servers.** All data generated and processed within the App remains exclusively on your device, except for data fetched directly by you from external services.

## 1. Information We Collect

**None from your device to any external servers.** Daily is designed to function primarily offline and locally on your device. It does not collect any personal information, usage data, location information, or any other type of data about you or your device and send it anywhere.

### Interaction with Google Calendar

The App interacts with your Google Calendar to retrieve calendar events. This interaction is **read-only** and is solely for the purpose of displaying your calendar events within the App. Daily does not store your Google Calendar data on any external servers, nor does it transmit this data to any third parties from any external servers. All processing and display of this calendar data occur locally on your device.

Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information regarding how Google collects, uses, and shares data when you use their services, including Google Calendar.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Since no information is collected or sent to external servers by Daily, there's no information for us to use for our own purposes. All operations, calculations, and any data storage (related to data generated *within* the app) are performed and maintained **solely on your device**. Your information never leaves your device and is not accessed by the project developer or any third parties, except for the read-only fetching of calendar events directly from Google Calendar to your device.

## 3. Sharing Your Information

Because no data is collected by Daily, there is **no information to share from our side**. We do not share any data with third parties, service providers, affiliates, or for any other purpose that we control. Your interaction with Google Calendar is governed by Google's policies.

## 4. Data Security

While Daily does not collect or transmit your data to any external servers, the security of any information stored locally on your device (including calendar data fetched from Google) is subject to the security measures of your device's operating system and your personal device security practices. We encourage you to maintain strong security settings on your device. When interacting with Google Calendar, the security of that data in transit and at rest on Google's servers is governed by Google's security protocols.

## 5. Your Data Protection Rights

Given that no data is collected or stored by Daily, traditional data protection rights related to accessing, rectifying, or erasing data held by a service provider do not apply. Your control over data generated within the App is managed entirely through your device's functionalities (e.g., deleting the app, clearing app data). For data related to your Google Calendar, please refer to Google's data management and privacy controls.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Daily does not collect any personal data from anyone to any external servers, including children under the age of 13. Therefore, parental consent is not required for data handling purposes by Daily.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated if Daily's functionality changes in a way that would involve new forms of data interaction or collection in the future. If such changes occur, they will be reflected here, and the "Last updated on" date will be revised. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
