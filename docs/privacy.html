<h1>Privacy Policy for Daily</h1>
<hr>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Daily</strong> (the "App") handles your information. <strong>Daily is a
    free, open-source hobby project developed for personal enjoyment.</strong> There is no company, formal team, or
    dedicated server infrastructure behind it.</p>

<p><strong>We want to be crystal clear: this App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage
    information from your device to any external servers.</strong> All data generated and processed within the App
    remains exclusively on your device, except for data fetched directly by you from external services.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>None from your device to any external servers.</strong> Daily is designed to function primarily offline and
    locally on your device. It does not collect any personal information, usage data, location information, or any other
    type of data about you or your device and send it anywhere.</p>

<h3>Interaction with Google Calendar</h3>

<p>The App interacts with your Google Calendar to retrieve calendar events. This interaction is
    <strong>read-only</strong> and is solely for the purpose of displaying your calendar events within the App. Daily
    does not store your Google Calendar data on any external servers, nor does it transmit this data to any third
    parties from any external servers. All processing and display of this calendar data occur locally on your device.
</p>

<p>Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information regarding how Google collects, uses, and shares data when you
    use their services, including Google Calendar.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>Since no information is collected or sent to external servers by Daily, there's no information for us to use for our
    own purposes. All operations, calculations, and any data storage (related to data generated <em>within</em> the app)
    are performed and maintained <strong>solely on your device</strong>. Your information never leaves your device and
    is not accessed by the project developer or any third parties, except for the read-only fetching of calendar events
    directly from Google Calendar to your device.</p>

<h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>

<p>Because no data is collected by Daily, there is <strong>no information to share from our side</strong>. We do not
    share any data with third parties, service providers, affiliates, or for any other purpose that we control. Your
    interaction with Google Calendar is governed by Google's policies.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>

<p>While Daily does not collect or transmit your data to any external servers, the security of any information stored
    locally on your device (including calendar data fetched from Google) is subject to the security measures of your
    device's operating system and your personal device security practices. We encourage you to maintain strong security
    settings on your device. When interacting with Google Calendar, the security of that data in transit and at rest on
    Google's servers is governed by Google's security protocols.</p>

<h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>

<p>Given that no data is collected or stored by Daily, traditional data protection rights related to accessing,
    rectifying, or erasing data held by a service provider do not apply. Your control over data generated within the App
    is managed entirely through your device's functionalities (e.g., deleting the app, clearing app data). For data
    related to your Google Calendar, please refer to Google's data management and privacy controls.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Daily does not collect any personal data from anyone to any external servers, including children under the age of 13.
    Therefore, parental consent is not required for data handling purposes by Daily.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated if Daily's functionality changes in a way that would involve new forms of data
    interaction or collection in the future. If such changes occur, they will be reflected here, and the "Last updated
    on" date will be revised. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
